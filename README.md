# Loopback Two-Factor Authentication Example

> The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

This example project highlights how to use two-factor authentication with a Loopback application. To get it up and running just clone the project and start it up with:

`slc run`

Keep that console open and head to http://localhost:3000 and click "Request Code". You should see a new code pop up in the console. Type that into the prompt and then you can click "Login Now!" to complete the login process. Note that the verification code expires rather quickly, so if it says there was a problem logging in, you may need to just generate a new code.
